Level 1 : BasicInteract
This is the level asked to confirm the second part of the project
Level 2 : Hell
Firstly, you will need to go through the spikes and the fireballs. Because of the air damage of these
spikes, you should manage to get to the other side. In order to do it easily, light the torch in the left
corner which will make hearts appear on the path. Then in the right corner, activate the lever which
will activate the mover right under the player. Light the torch to go through the blocks that
transformed into wooden boxes by shooting fireballs on them. Avoid or kill the slimes with the
playerâ€™s fireballs. After getting to the left corner, activate which will send the movers to the left and
make the key available by walljumping
and unlock the blue door. Then jump to the last timed lever
and get to the exit on the right side after killing/avoiding the slimes (hurry up!).
Level 3 : Limbo
At the beginning of the level, you will appear near the exit door but you don't have the yellow key to
open it. You can observe that this yellow key is behind the wall near the door.
To get there you will have to activate the stairs with the lever on your right to open a secret passage.
Once you are on the first floor, you will have to take the green key to unlock the green door. On your
way to the green door you can test your luck with the torches ;)
Then you can access the yellow key by avoiding the jumpers with your agility. Once you have the
yellow key, use the jumpers to access the roof. (hint: woodboxes do not like fire).
On the roof an army of slimes is waiting for you. Take your courage to kill them.
Jump to access the first floor again. You will find a simple puzzle to solve with the torches. (hint: look
at the bit strings).
A stone will disappear on your right and unlock a secret passage.
Then you will have to get the blue key and activate three levers in order to go back to the exit door.
